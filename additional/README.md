# Recommendation System with Decision Tree

This repository contains the code for a recommendation system based on a decision tree algorithm. The system asks users 10 questions to provide personalized recommendations.

## How it Works

1. **Dataset:** The dataset used for training and testing the recommendation system is available in the `dataset` folder.

2. **Notebook:** The implementation of the recommendation system can be found in the Jupyter Notebook named `recommendation_system.ipynb`. Open the notebook to explore the code, methodology, and results.
